# Array Self Evaluation

How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- I feel very comfortable in my understanding about arrays and everything provided in this lesson. The information was easy to grasp. I will need to learn more methods but have understood 4 of the 5 taught. I do need to practice the splice method.
- I need to practice creating a Boolean array.

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- Yes, I do want to practice the methods until I can use them without using my notes.
- I am also confusing myself with the Booleans. I did not really know how to make a Boolean array with 4 or more elements because I thought that one was always only true or false.

What questions do you have about Arrays?
- What are different examples of Boolean arrays?
- Can we always make what our elements are for the variable? I was practicing in replit and I named a variable ages but the elements I gave them were strings so they weren't numbers. Replit didn't run the code so I was wondering if replit knows that variables named with what should be a number will only allow for elements with numbers?
